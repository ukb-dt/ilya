Great question — let’s walk through what your **heart** and **lungs** are *getting* (inputs) and *giving* (outputs) across those scenarios. I’ll also tie it back to the **fractal/complexity** framework in the *Loss of Complexity and Aging* article you uploaded.

# 🫀 Heart & 🫁 Lungs Across Activity States

## 1. **100m Sprint**

* **Inputs**: Sudden spike in sympathetic drive; ATP demand skyrockets; blood lactate builds; O₂ extraction near-maximal.
* **Outputs**:

  * Heart: HR near max (180–200 bpm if young); stroke volume high but limited by filling time.
  * Lungs: Ventilation rate and tidal volume surge; O₂ consumption (VO₂) and CO₂ blow-off maxed.
  * Dynamics: Extreme variability, chaotic fluctuations in milliseconds (beat-to-beat HRV compressed but not absent).

---

## 2. **9-mile Run (steady high intensity)**

* **Inputs**: Sustained high O₂ demand, lactate threshold stress, heat buildup.
* **Outputs**:

  * Heart: HR \~150–170 bpm, consistent; cardiac output stable at high level.
  * Lungs: VO₂ plateau near VO₂max, ventilation efficient but heavy.
  * Dynamics: Fractal-like oscillations visible — HR variability narrows compared to rest, but remains adaptive (complexity preserved).

## 3. **Marathon Jog**

* **Inputs**: Glycogen depletion, rising fat metabolism, dehydration risk, core temp stress.
* **Outputs**:

  * Heart: HR \~120–150 bpm, long adaptive plateau; stroke volume steady.
  * Lungs: Large, regular tidal volume; O₂ uptake moderate-high.
  * Dynamics: Oscillations shift toward lower-frequency bands — complexity reduced but still “healthy chaotic.” Endurance training protects against entropy loss.

## 4. **30-Mile Walk**

* **Inputs**: Low-intensity demand, fat oxidation primary, musculoskeletal load.
* **Outputs**:

  * Heart: HR \~80–110 bpm, steady with slight variability.
  * Lungs: Comfortable breathing, closer to baseline.
  * Dynamics: More predictable, lower entropy — like a “slowed orchestra” compared to sprinting.

---

## 5. **Spa Rest**

* **Inputs**: Minimal metabolic demand, parasympathetic tone dominates.
* **Outputs**:

  * Heart: HR \~40–60 bpm if trained (sinus bradycardia possible); variability (HRV) high, showing healthy adaptability.
  * Lungs: Low tidal volume, slow respiration.
  * Dynamics: Maximum complexity in *variability* — microfluctuations show fractal patterns.

# 🌳 Complexity Lens (from Lipsitz & Goldberger)

* **Youth/fitness**: Your time series at each level (sprint → spa) would show *high approximate entropy* (healthy chaos, fractal variability).
* **Aging/illness**: Means and SD may stay similar, but variability collapses — the *fractal “bushiness”* prunes back.
* **Key insight**: It’s not just HR or VO₂ means that matter, but whether your system can flex across scales of stress.

---

✅ So:

* **Inputs** = metabolic demands (ATP/O₂), nervous system signals, environmental stress.
* **Outputs** = HR, stroke volume, ventilation rate, VO₂/CO₂ exchange, plus the *variability signatures* in their time series.

Want me to actually **draw up a table** with these five states (inputs/outputs/dynamics side-by-side), so you can drop it straight into your README or GitHub docs?
